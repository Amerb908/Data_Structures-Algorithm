# CPU Data Structures Project

## Overview

This project is a CPU data structures program that allows users to search for CPUs based on various criteria such as price, clock speed, power draw, and brand. The program utilizes Python and implements various data structures and algorithms for sorting and searching the CPU data.

## Features

- Search for CPUs below a certain price.
- Search for CPUs above a certain max clock speed.
- Search for CPUs below a certain max power draw.
- Search for CPUs based on brand (Intel or AMD).
- Show all CPUs in the inventory.

## Data Format

The CPU data is stored in a text file named `CPU_Info.txt`, where each line represents the details of a CPU in the following format:

# Data_Structures-Algorithm
This is a project where we would have to take 20 different texts of different CPU's specs, and try and filter it using sorting algorithms.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` script using Python to launch the CPU data structures program.
3. The program will display a main menu with options to search for CPUs based on different criteria or to display all CPUs in the inventory.
4. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter search criteria (e.g., price, max clock speed, etc.).
6. The program will display the CPUs that match the specified criteria.
7. After each search operation, you can press Enter to return to the main menu and perform another search or exit the program.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script to run the CPU data structures program.
- `CPU.py`: Defines the `Cpu` class to represent a CPU object and its attributes.
- `CPUInventory.py`: Defines the `CpuInventory` class to manage the list of CPUs and perform search operations.
- `CPUInterface.py`: Implements the user interface for the CPU data structures program.
- `sorting_algorithms.py`: Contains the sorting algorithms used to sort the CPU data.
- `CPU_Info.txt`: The text file containing the CPU data in the specified format.
